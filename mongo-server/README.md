# MongoDB and Backend Services Documentation

## MongoDB Installation and Management

1. **Install MongoDB:**
   Follow the steps in the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyIiM7z_j_Y) to install MongoDB.

2. **Start MongoDB:**
   ```bash
   brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
   ```

3. **Stop MongoDB:**
   ```bash
   brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
   ```

4. **Restart MongoDB:**
   ```bash
   brew services restart mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
   ```

5. **Connect to MongoDB Shell:**
   After starting MongoDB, open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   mongosh
   ```

6. **Use MongoDB Compass:**
   - Open the MongoDB Compass application.
   - Click on "New connection."
   - Enter URI: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
   - Click "Connect."

   Now, you can view all databases and collections.

1. **Start Backend Server:**

After cloning the repository, follow these steps to start the MongoDB server:

```bash
# Navigate to the mongo-server directory
cd mongo-server
npm install
# Start the server on port 3010
npm start
```

This will initiate the MongoDB server, and it will be accessible on port 3010. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configurations set up as per the project requirements. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation or seek assistance from the team.

2. **Run Custom Application:**
   - The custom application is located at `mongo-server/index.html`.
   - Double-click on `index.html` in Finder or Explorer to run the application.
   - This waas created to mimic an application calling the APIs. Not a part of our actual project.

3. **Image Size Limitation:**
   Currently, the application supports images up to 50kb. To handle larger images, consider implementing GridFS for MongoDB.

4. **Postman Collection:**
   A Postman Collection with all API calls and request body structures will be shared via email.

## Additional Files

- **API DOCS.txt:**
  Contains a list of all APIs with URIs and their purposes.

- **ERD.txt (Entity Relationship Diagram):**
  Shows the structure of the category and image entities. Note: `_id` is auto-generated by MongoDB; use `id` in request bodies.

- **UML.txt (Unified Modeling Language):**
  Displays routes, controllers, and services, along with the structure of categories and images.

## Backend Functionality

- The backend server creates a database named `pictionary` if it doesn't exist.
- It creates collections 'categories' and 'images' within the 'pictionary' database.
- If 'pictionary' exists, it checks for the collections; if they don't exist, they are created.
- New records are inserted using relevant POST APIs.
- Records are fetched using relevant GET APIs.
- Updates are made using relevant PUT APIs.
- Deletion is performed using relevant DELETE APIs.
- Additional APIs provide counts, fetch images by category, and more (refer to API DOCS.txt).

## Conclusion

All APIs have been thoroughly tested on Postman and a custom application. Integrating these services into your Flutter app should be seamless. For any further assistance, please refer to the provided documentation and resources.
